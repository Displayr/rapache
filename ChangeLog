2008-10-08 Jeffrey Horner <jeff.horner@vanderbilt.edu>

	* RApacheOutputErrors had no effect on functions that were
	smart enough to trap errors with try, e.g. brew. The fix is to

	data, then we clear the pushback with .Internal(clearPushBack(stdin()))

	response status code. status=TRUE will return 200, status=FALSE
	will return 500.
