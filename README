               The R/Apache Integration Project

  What is it?
  -----------
  R/Apache is a project dedicated to embedding the R interpreter inside
  the Apache 2.0 (and beyond) web server. It's composed of three parts:

  mod_R: the Apache 2.0 module that implements the glue to load the
  R interpreter.

  RApache: the R package that provides the API for programming web
  applications in R.

  libapreq 2.0.4: an Apache sponsored project for parsing request input.
  If you don't want to compile and install this version, then you can
  specify which libapreq2 library to use during configuration.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found at the R/Apache
  project page:

	http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/RApacheProject

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  This release has been tested under Debian Linux with Apache 2.0.55,
  R 2.2.1, and libapreq 2.0.4.  Apache2 _MUST_ be compiled with the
  prefork MPM to compile mod_R. Also, R must have been compiled with
  the --enable-R-shlib configure flag.

  Installation
  ------------
  The following is the preferred way to compile and install mod_R:

    $ ./configure --with-apache2-apxs=/path/to/apxs --with-R=/path/to/R
    $ make
    $ make install

  Both --with-apache2-apxs and --with-R _MUST_ be specified.  Otherwise,
  trying to figure out the dependencies between the sources and headers
  and library paths becomes quite complex.

  If you don't want to compile and install the bundled libapreq2 version,
  then add --with-apreq2-config=/path/to/apreq2-config. The version _MUST_
  be equal to or greater than 2.0.4.

  Configuration
  -------------
  In order to use mod_R and RApache, you must configure apache to find
  it. Type help("directives",package="RApache") once mod_R is installed
  for a little more detail. Add something similar to this to the apache
  config file:

    LoadModule R_module /path/to/mod_R.so

    <Location /URL>
       SetHandler r-handler
       Rsource /path/to/R/code.R
       RreqHandler function-name
       Rlibrary library-name
    </Location>

  Also, libR.so _MUST_ be found in the shared library path as it is
  linked to by mod_R, RApache and the rest of the packages containing
  shared libraries. You can either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH like this:

     $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`/path/to/R RHOME`/lib

  or add that path to /etc/ld.so.conf and then run ldconfig. 

  NOTE: the latest apache2 debian packages cause the web server to run
  in a very reduced environment, thus one is unable to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  before calling /etc/init.d/apache2. One option is to actually edit that
  file and add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH explicitly. Another is to use the apache2ctl
  scripts which are also bundled with the debian packages. Or you can add it
  to /etc/ld.so.conf.

  Documentation
  -------------
  All of the documentation is currently in the RApache package. Once
  you install mod_R, start R and load the RApache package. You'll get
  a warning that you're currently not running the R interpreter within
  Apache; just don't try to run any of the code. Sample session:

   > library(RApache)
   Warning message:

   RApache is only useful within the Apache web server.
   It is loaded now for informational purposes only

    in: firstlib(which.lib.loc, package)
   > help(package="RApache")
