Changes in 0.1.3

    *) Now plays nicely with mod_cgi (thanks to Jeremy Stephens).
       Apache runs cleanup code per-child after a fork and before
       executing cgi scripts. This was not handled properly, and R/Apache
       caused the child to segfault.

Changes in 0.1.2

    *) Libraries and source files (specified with Rlibrary and Rsource
       in the apache config) are now loaded only once (thanks to Jeremy
       Stephens).

    *) Added mod_R version component to Apache response headers

Changes in 0.1.1

    *) Fixed spelling of R_module (thanks to Kevin E. Thorpe) in README
       and RApache/man/directives.Rd.

    *) Fixed compile error on Mac OS X (thanks to Jan de Leeuw).

    *) Fixed bug in as.list.apr_table (thanks to Gregoire Thomas) and
       subsequently in as.list.ra_request_rec
